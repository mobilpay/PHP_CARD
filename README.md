## Merchant's Response
For each call to your confirm URL, you will need to send a response in XML format back to mobilPay, in order to help us understand whether you have successfully recorded the response or not.

For debugging purposes, you may view your response in mobilPay console (Order – Details – Merchant Communication Log)

The following annotated description of the XML response structure shows the elements sent by you to the NETOPIA Payments API.

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
    <crc error_type=”1|2” error_code=”{numeric}”>{message}</crc>

The attributes of the crc element are only sent if you had any problem recording
the **IPN**.
- ### error_type 
    - set error_type  to "1", if there is a temporary error 
    - set error_type  to "2", if there is a permanent error

- ### error_code
    This is your internal error code.
- ### message
    Your message, to helping you find the error.

## Security
The NETOPIA Payments API service is protected to ensure that only authorized members use it.

There are three levels of security:
1. Request authentication using an API Signature included in the request (Signature field)

2. The data exchanged between the client → NETOPIA Payments server and back is encrypted using RSA keys

3. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) data transport for the request, optional, if available
on the merchant side, for the response.
